1.  stdint,h is a header file in the C std library allowing typedefs specifying exact width integer types, using macros.
2.  To allow use of integer types of an exact size, e.g. usint8_t is exactly 8 bytes long.
3.  BYTE: 1 byte, DWORD: 4 bytes, LONG: 4 bytes, WORD: 2 bytes.
4.  WORD called bfType which specifies the file type. For BITMAP it must be BM (0x4d42).
5.  bfSize is the total size in bytes of the bitmap file. biSize is the size of the bitmap file minus the bytes used for the BITMAPHEADER and BITMAPINFO
6.  When biHeight is negative the bitmap is interpreted from the top of the file down, with the first RGBTRIPLE in the top left.
7.  biBitCount.
8.  If either the infile doesn't exist, or the outfile cannot be created.
9.  The 1 refers to the number of elements to be read. In our case we treat BITMAPINFO and BITMAPHEADER as 1 element each.
10. 3
11. Moves the file position to a desired location within the file.
12. Specifies that the padding offset is a count of characters from the current file position.
