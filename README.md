# cs50

I completed the verified track of HarvardX's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science over late 2017 to early 2018. These were my solutions to the problem sets.

I've included versions of the cs50.c, cs50.h and cs50.py helper files in the folders of the problem sets that required them, although changes are likely required to get projects to compile or run.

Included is a spellchecker, a DES-hashed password cracker, and a luhn validator.
