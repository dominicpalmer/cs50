# cs50
I completed the verified track of HarvardX's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science over late 2017 to early 2018. Listed here are all of my submitted solutions to the problem sets.

I've included a version of the cs50.c, cs50.h and cs50.py helper files in the folders of the problems sets that required them. Note that these utility files have likely been altered in the time since I completed the course, meaning some projects may not compile or run without appropriate revisions.

The problem sets include the implementation of a spellchecker, DES-hashed password cracker, luhn validator and various other tasks.
