0.  A word that is 45 characters long, the max length accepted.
1.  Gets resource usage.
2.  16.
3.  Passing big structs by value takes up a lot of stack memory and is slow.
4.  Main opens the text file, and iterates through every character in the file. It creates a word buffer for appending
the characters that are alphabetical only, and uses a loop system to form full words. It also ignores strings of
characters that are too long to be words, and ignores alphanumerical strings. Once the word is complete, it is
completed with a null entry, then the words counter is updated, and finally the word is passed into the spellchecker.
5.  Using scanf could cause problems because in text files, there is not always one distinguishing factor that defines
what each word is. For example, a word could follow a space or a hyphen, could end with a newline or some punctuation.
The text files are not formatted in a way that allows the use of scanf.
6.  Because it is important the dictionary and contents of the text file to be checked are not altered once data has started to be
pass in and entered/checked.
